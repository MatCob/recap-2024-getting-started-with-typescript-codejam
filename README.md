# re>â‰¡CAP 2024 - Getting Started with TypeScript workshop

## Description

This repository contains the material for the hands-on workshop on getting started with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model and TypeScript to create a Full-Stack Application. In this hands-on workshop we will learn how to create a new SAP Cloud Application Programming Model-based application (including SAP Fiori Elements app) using TypeScript and run it locally in a test launchpad.

## Exercises

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository, including hardware and software, are detailed in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises. Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

### Following the exercises

During the hands-on workshop you will complete each exercise one at a time. Everyone can work in his own pace and ask questions wherever needed. Each exercise has a time indication mentioned, the instructors will do time keeping to make sure you are on track. Instead of just executing the steps mentioned in the guides, I suggest you also have a look at the mentioned documents to get the broader context on why we're doing the things in a certain way.

> The exercises are written in a conversational way; this is so that they have enough context and information to be completed outside the hands-on session itself. To help you navigate and find what you have to actually do next, there are pointers like this ðŸ‘‰ throughout that indicate the things you have to actually do (as opposed to just read for background information).
