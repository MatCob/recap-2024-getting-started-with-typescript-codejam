# Transforming the sample project to TypeScript

## Reviewing the current service implementation

Currently our service implementation is written in JavaScript. In the sample project, there are two handlers registered on two different entities of the service.

- After read handler for entity Authors (calculates the total amount of books in stock for an author and updates the virtual field totalBooksInStock)
- On updateStock handler for the action registered on entity books (the action allows us to update the stock of a book by providing the parameter quantity)

ðŸ‘‰ Before enabling TypeScript in the project, try out the current code assistance options. You'll notice as in below example there's actually no real code assistance, just some suggestions.

## Enabling TypeScript for our project

Enabling TypeScript for a project is quite easy, the TypeScript compiler only needs a tsconfig.json file in the root of the project.

ðŸ‘‰ Create a new file called tsconfig.json in the root of the project

ðŸ‘‰ Copy below configuration in the file and save

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "rootDir": "./",
        "target": "ESNext",
        "module": "NodeNext",
        "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
        "strict": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true
    }
}
```

## Running the project with TypeScript

ðŸ‘‰  We're all set to launch our project & start testing our existing logic with TypeScript, launch the project by running the watch command and wait for the server to start (notice the slightly changed command cds -> cds-ts)

    cds-ts watch

Notice that the cds-ts command still loads the original JavaScript implementation? That's because we didn't change our implementation to TypeScript yet. We'll do so in the next chapters.

ðŸ‘‰ Terminate the running server with CTRL + C (or CMD + C on MacOS)

## Adding the CDS typer to the project

Since we're going to use TypeScript, we'll need to create types for our existing data model / services. Sounds like a lot of work right?

Good news! SAP provides the [CDS typer](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/tools/cds-typer) package to generate types for our data model & services! Let's go ahead and install the CDS typer package!

ðŸ‘‰ Install the CDS typer with following command

    cds-ts add typer

Notice how our previously created tsconfig file is extended with additional information (location for our generated types):

![CAP Project - Adding cds typer to the project](images/5.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Manually generate the types for the existing project with following command:

    npx @cap-js/cds-typer '*' --outputDirectory @cds-models

If the command asks to install package @cap-js/cds-typer confirm with 'y':
