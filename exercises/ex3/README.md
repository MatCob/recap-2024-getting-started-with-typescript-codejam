# Exercise 3 - Adding a TypeScript Fiori Elements app

## Adding a TypeScript-based SAP Fiori Elements template to our project with SAP Fiori Tools

ðŸ‘‰ Open the "Command Palette"

ðŸ‘‰ Select the "Authors" as main entity

ðŸ‘‰ Ensure the navigation entity is set to "None"

ðŸ‘‰ Set option "Automatically add table columns to the list ... " to "No" (the base project already provides annotations to properly create a UI)

ðŸ‘‰ Set following project attributes

| Attribute | Value |
| -------- | ------- |
| Module name | authors |
| Application title | Authors |
| Description | Display Authors |
| Add deployment configuration to MTA project | No (not needed for this workshop, since we're not focussing on the build / deployment process) |
| Add FLP configuration | Yes (important, this will be used in exercise 4 to test the application in the local launchpad) |
| Configure advanced options | Yes (allows us to select TypeScript) |
| Add code assist libraries to your project | Yes (enables code completion during development) |
| Generation of this application can update the CAP project to use NPM workspaces and an associated CDS plugin library (cds-plugin-ui5) | Yes (enables the UI5 tooling plugin for CAP, which will enable live transpilation of the TypeScript source code during development) |
| Enable TypeScript | Yes |

ðŸ‘‰ Go to the next step by clicking "Next"

| Attribute | Value |
| -------- | ------- |
| Semantic Object | Authors |
| Action | display |
| Title | Authors |
| Subtitle | display |

ðŸ‘‰ Click "Finish" to start the actual application generation

## Running our project again with TypeScript & our newly created app

ðŸ‘‰ Explore the generated project, notice that the project is properly generated using TypeScript (Component.ts & tsconfig.json files present)

ðŸ‘‰ Open up a new terminal window (or re-use one if you still have one open)

![CAP Project - Sample Handlers](images/11.png)

ðŸ‘‰  We're all set to launch our project & start testing our fullstack application with TypeScript, launch the project again by running the watch command and wait for the server to start.

    cds-ts watch

ðŸ‘‰ Notice that the CDS watch command now outputs some additional information from the cds-ui5-plugin (live reload & live transpilation enabled)

ðŸ‘‰ Open the CAP Service & open the generated application

ðŸ‘‰ Try-out the application
