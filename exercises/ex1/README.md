# Cloning the exercise repository & running the base project

During this session we'll be working on an existing project which contains a basic data model and an existing service implementation in JavaScript. In this session we'll transform the existing JavaScript implementation into TypeScript and an SAPUI5 application to the project (also using TypeScript).

ðŸ‘‰ Start by cloning this repository into your local Business Application Studio workspace.

The terminal will open in the root of the cloned repository. During the session we'll want to execute all commandline commands in the actual project folder. 

ðŸ‘‰ Change the terminal folder location with following command

    cd workspace/recap-typescript-workshop

ðŸ‘‰ The cloned project only contains the actual project, to get started we need to install the project to get all re-used projects / dependencies from the package manager (default npmjs). Do so by executing the install command

    npm install

ðŸ‘‰  We're all set to launch our project & start testing our existing logic, launch the project by running the watch command and wait for the server to start

    cds watch
